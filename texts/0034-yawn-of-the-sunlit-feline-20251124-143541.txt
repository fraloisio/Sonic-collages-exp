TITLE: Yawn of the Sunlit Feline
TIMESTAMP (UTC): 20251124-143541

ANALYSIS:
A white and black kitten yawns widely, its mouth open to reveal pink gums and small teeth. Long whiskers extend from its muzzle, and its ears are perked forward. The background is softly blurred with warm, out-of-focus tones, suggesting natural daylight. The kitten’s fur appears soft and clean, with a gentle glow on its neck and shoulders.

LONG PROMPT:
Design a rich, resonant yawn sound with a subtle inhale, layered with soft vocalizations, spatially placed to feel close and intimate, enveloped in warm ambient textures that mimic golden-hour air.
