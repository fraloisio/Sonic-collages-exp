TITLE: Blank Pages, Ready to Create
TIMESTAMP (UTC): 20251124-144902

ANALYSIS:
An open notebook with blank pages rests on a weathered wooden surface, surrounded by scattered stationery: colorful pencils, paintbrushes, scissors, paper clips, and tape dispensers. The tools are arranged in a loose circle, suggesting preparation for artistic or creative work.

LONG PROMPT:
Design a textured, ambient soundscape with gentle paper rustles, occasional metallic clicks from clips, and soft scraping of brushes on a surface—layered with a warm, rhythmic heartbeat of creation, as if a workspace breathes with anticipation.
